# 🎧 SoundMap — Visualize Music with AI

SoundMap is a fun and powerful tool that uses machine learning to visualize how songs relate to each other based on musical features like danceability, tempo, energy, and more.

By applying dimensionality reduction techniques like UMAP, t-SNE, and PCA, SoundMap reveals hidden patterns and clusters in your music data—just like a Spotify-style genre map.

## 🚀 Features
- 🎵 Simulates Spotify-style song features
- 🧠 Uses AI techniques to reduce high-dimensional music data into beautiful 2D visualizations
- 📊 Compare PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP projections
- 🎨 Clear genre-based clustering with interactive plots

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. Simulates or loads real music data with acoustic features
2. Standardizes the feature values
3. Applies 3 different dimensionality reduction techniques:
   - **PCA** – linear projection
   - **t-SNE** – preserves local structure
   - **UMAP** – preserves both local & global structure
4. Visualizes genre-based clusters in 2D

## 🧑‍💻 Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kirankumarvel/soundmap.git
cd soundmap
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧪 Run the Project
```bash
python soundmap.py
```
Or use it in a Jupyter Notebook:
```python
# Open Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

## 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- umap-learn

Install with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn umap-learn
```

## 🔍 Sample Output
- ✅ **PCA Projection** – A basic linear snapshot
- ✅ **t-SNE Projection** – Preserves local song similarity
- ✅ **UMAP Projection** – Captures both local and global song clusters

## 🧠 Use Case Ideas
- Visualize your own Spotify playlist features
- Use for genre classification insights
- Enhance audio analysis or recommendation systems
- Embed in a music exploration tool

## 📂 Folder Structure
```bash
soundmap/
├── soundmap.py           # Main executable
├── README.md             # Project overview
└── requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
```

## 📊 Use Cases
- Music mood exploration
- Recommender systems
- Audio feature clustering
- Educational visualizations for ML & data science

## 💡 Ideas to Extend
- Plug in Spotify API to fetch real song features
- Add interactive Plotly visualizations
- Cluster labeling and analysis (e.g., genres, tempo zones)
